# Overview

**The Problem**: UH students who paint, draw, sculpt, photograph, and so on do not have a public place to showcase their art to other individuals. Although there is the Manoa Creative Production Discord server, it is not a convenient place for people to look at a specific person’s art, nor a place for sculptures, photographs, ceramics, etc.

**The Solution**: The UH Student Art Gallery allows users to post images of their art for anyone to view. Other users will be able to add comments under artworks.

## Approach

The landing page will list the features of the web app, such as the gallery, posting artworks, and adding comments.

Regular users can login with their UH account, which allows them to view the whole gallery, post images of their artworks, view their posts, and add comments to other user's posts. Note that users who are not logged in are unable to access the gallery or perform the other listed actions.

Admins monitor the gallery and can delete any inappropriate posts and comments.

The gallery will initially show the most recent artworks. Users can filter for specific artworks (e.g. sculptures, digital art, hand-drawn, etc.) or user’s artworks. Alternatively, they could sort by date, alphabetically, or usernames.

Possible mockup pages include:
* Landing page
* Login
* Sign-Up
* Home
* Profile
* Edit Profile
* Studio
* Search
* Photo Interation

# Use Case Ideas

* New user goes to landing page, logs in, gets to user landing page, learns how to use the application.
* User goes to landing page, logs in, gets to user landing page, browses the art gallery or adds their own art.
* Admin goes to landing page, logs in, gets to user landing page, monitors the gallery.

# Beyond the Basics

Some potential advance features include:
* Implement profile pages for users
* Allow users to filter out certain artwork
* Design a role for professors or experts separate from admins and regular users

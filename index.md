# Overview

The Problem: UH students who paint, draw, sculpt, photograph, and so on do not have a public place to showcase their art to other individuals. Although there is the Manoa Creative Production Discord server, it is not a convenient place for people to look at a specific person’s art, nor a place for sculptures, photographs, ceramics, etc.

The Solution: The UH Student Art Gallery allows users to post images of their art for anyone to view. Other users will be able to add comments under artworks.

# Outline

## Landing 

<img width="400px" class="text-center p-4" align="center" src="/Images/pages/home-page.png">

This image represents what a home page may look like for this project. Users will be able to see a gallery of photos, as well as have downward scrolling capabilities to view content in addition to what is currently rendered on their screen. 


## Sign-Up 

<img width="400px" class="p-4" align="center" src="/Images/pages/sign-up-page-mockup.png">

This is what the sign up page may look like. New users will be able to create an account with a username, email, and password to log in.

## Login 

<img width="400px" class="p-4" align="center" src="/Images/pages/login-page-mockup.png">

This is what the login page may look like. Users will be able to enter their username/email and password to log into their account.

## Home

## Profile
<img width="400px" class="text-center p-4" align="center" src="/Images/pages/profile.png">

The profile page of our application will be inspired by VSCO's (as shown above). The top of the page will detail the user's profile picture, their username, and a short description. Below will be a collage of the user's posted artwork in a gallery. We will also provide an "Edit Profile" option for the user. 

### Edit Profile

## Studio

## Search

## Photo Interaction
<img src="/Images/pages/photo_interaction_page.png" width="500px">

This shows what happens when a user decieds to click on an image. This will allow the user to view the image in full screen and be able to share the image. They may also
star it and favorite their images.

## Approach

The landing page will list the features of the web app, such as the gallery, posting artworks, and adding comments.

Regular users can login with their UH account, which allows them to view the whole gallery, post images of their artworks, view their posts, and add comments to other user's posts. Note that users who are not logged in are unable to access the gallery or perform the other listed actions.

Admins monitor the gallery and can delete any inappropriate posts and comments.

The gallery will initially show the most recent artworks. Users can filter for specific artworks (e.g. sculptures, digital art, hand-drawn, etc.) or user’s artworks. Alternatively, they could sort by date, alphabetically, or usernames.

Possible mockup pages include:
* Landing page
* Login
* Sign-Up
* Home
* Profile
* Edit Profile
* Studio
* Search
* Photo Interation

# Use Case Ideas

* New user goes to landing page, logs in, gets to user landing page, learns how to use the application.
* User goes to landing page, logs in, gets to user landing page, browses the art gallery or adds their own art.
* Admin goes to landing page, logs in, gets to user landing page, monitors the gallery.

# Beyond the Basics

Some potential advance features include:
* Implement profile pages for users
* Allow users to filter out certain artwork
* Design a role for professors or experts separate from admins and regular users

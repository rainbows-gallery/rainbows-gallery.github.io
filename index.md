# Overview

**The Problem**: UH students who paint, draw, sculpt, photograph, and so on do not have a public place to showcase their art to other individuals. Although there is the Manoa Creative Production Discord server, it is not a convenient place for people to look at a specific personâ€™s art, nor a place for sculptures, photographs, ceramics, etc.

**The Solution**: The UH Student Art Gallery allows users to post images of their art for anyone to view. Users will be able to add comments under artworks and star posts they like for easy reference.
